If your system is Windows, make sure you have installed Python 3.13 on your system, then run following command in the directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python spider_test.py

If your system is Arch Linux, run following command in the directory:

sudo pacman -S python python-requests python-lxml nltk-data python-nltk
python spider_test.py

The test program will first try to read webpages.db. If the database can be read, it will use the data in the database to generate spider_result.txt. Otherwise, it will crawl the webpages and generate the spider_result.txt. Then, it will run the indexer to generate or update body_inverted_index.db and title_inverted_index.db

Our spider and our indexer are in two separated functions. The spider can only generate the forward index, and the generation of inverted index and keyword stemming are done by the indexer. The title keywords are generated by the indexer or the test program, not the spider. The spider will only generate the body keywords. Our database schema and the information about cyclic path handling are in schema.md.

The default value of the last modified date is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. When a webpage is being visited, the spider will first check the Last-Modified key in the header. If the Last-Modified key exists, it will insert it into the date property of the webpage. Otherwise, it will treat the current time as the last modified date.

The project phase 1 is done by Yu Yingxuan and Du Maosen only. The two other persons in our group did not participate in the project. Wu Lixin has applied to late-drop for this course, so it is unfair to let him contribute something to our project. Even so, he emailed to us and demonstrated his case, and he provided some ideas to our program. By contrast, Lin Xuanyu is much more irresponsible. He has not replied any words to we three since our group was found, whether via Email or via Canvas.
